My first website withe the Odin Project.
This project demonstrates my understanding of basic html
tags, such as the p, img, and a tags.
Recipes are pulled from my family's cookbook and online websites.

I came back to this project to demonstrate a basic understanding of css styles and how to apply them to multiple elements on a web page. (Primarily classes for this project.)
